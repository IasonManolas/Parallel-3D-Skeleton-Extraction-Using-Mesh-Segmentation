There are several works performing accurate skeleton extraction, however, their main drawback is the extensive computational requirements and the lack of solutions that can be executed in multi-core computing systems. These challenges, become more demanding when we are dealing with dense 3D models. To cope with this scarcity we propose a novel method that extends a well known contraction-based skeletonization method, enabling its decentralization resulting in significant improvement in skeleton extraction times.
