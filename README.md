This is the implementation of our paper "Parallel 3D Skeleton Extraction Using Mesh Segmentation" https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8590036

In this work we examine the skeletonization of 3D meshes. Our goal is to propose an alternate approach which exploits the existence of multi-core architectures in modern computing systems, resulting in significant decrease of skeletonization times. Our approach extends an existing contraction-based skeletonization method, enabling its parallelization. We set the necessary theoretical foundation for a concrete understanding of 3D skeletonization and do a thorough analysis of the state of the art in the field. We consider in detail a particular skeletonization method and pay closer attention to its most important stages which are mesh contraction and the conversion of the contracted mesh into a skeleton. Lastly we fully analyze our method presenting in detail its theoretical basis as well as the results it produces. Within the context of this thesis we have implemented the contraction-based skeletonization method we extend and make use of it in the novel parallel approach we propose. Our application was created using the C++ language, Qt for the GUI, CGAL for geometric structures and algorithms, the boost library for the skeleton representation as well as OpenGL for all visualizations.
